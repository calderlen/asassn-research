- LCs with bright nearby stars should be removed from the calibrated light curve folders

- Dippers
    - get coordinates of
        - continuous variables
            - which of these to cut out?
            - which fo these to leave in?
        - mixed variables that are not dippers
            - which of these to cut out?
            - which of these to leave in?
        - non-continuous variables
            - which of these to cut out?
            - which of these to leave in?
    - match their (proper-motion propagated) coordiantes to light curved index BEFORE they are analyzed, and cut them out from the indices
        - how should you match?
            - gaia id? or will this miss some
            - RA, DEC + optional ID match?
    - from the updated light curve indices, search light curves at lower magnitudes using the same(?) search criteria as Brayden
