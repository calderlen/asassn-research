- Create file that has the first line/header as the variables the code will output are "ASAS-SN ID','Pstarrs gmag", "Median", "Median_err','Dispersion','Slope','Quad Slope','coeff1','coeff2','max diff"
- update the file paths for the i/o and outline which directories you'll be looping through to look for the light curve files


- what LTvar.py is
    - loops through files in a given directory/set of directories
    - finds where the observing season breaks are beased on the sun's position in RA and dec
    - separates file into different df's corresponding to each df
    - finds the median of each observing season
    - does 1d and 2d fits to assign slopes and max differences to each light curve; also outputs some other things
    - if you loop throuhg a lot of directories, such as all the cal files in 12-1.5, it will output a file for each subdirectory where each one adds onto the last one -- this is here because if you run into a funky light curve that doesn't have much data or just doesn't work through the script, you won't lose the progress leading up to it
    - most of the middle of the script is several configurations for light curves that had missing or bad data in ceratin seasons - but since it's run through 13e6 light curves, not much more may need added

So the light curve files are in these directories 13_13.5 means things
from 13.0 to 13.5 mag

$dir[0] = '/data/poohbah/1/assassin/rowan.90/lcsv2/13_13.5/';
$dir[1] = '/data/poohbah/1/assassin/rowan.90/lcsv2/13.5_14/';
$dir[2] = '/data/poohbah/1/assassin/rowan.90/lcsv2/14_14.5/';
$dir[3] = '/data/poohbah/1/assassin/rowan.90/lcsv2/14.5_15/';
$dir[4] = '/data/poohbah/1/assassin/rowan.90/lcsv2/12_12.5/';
$dir[5] = '/data/poohbah/1/assassin/rowan.90/lcsv2/12.5_13/';

in each directory there are a set of index files

index#.csv  (ignore the one without a #)

which correspond to the light curves in lc# (downloaded from hawaii) 
lc#_cal (calibrated etc) -- so the ones you should analyze are the
lc#_cal ones

the index files have the columns listed at top, the first # is the
asas-sn ID used by sky patrol 2 - so the raw light curve is

lc#/id.csv - these also have the columns labeled

lc*_cal/id.dat

           jd, mag, error, good, camera, v/g band?, saturated?, cam/field

good =1  = good  =0 likely bad

camera = a unique # for each camera/field in the light curve -

v/g band 1=V band 0 = g band

saturated - none of these should be

For the slow drifts, probably should just use good=1 data -- for
dippers, I am a little worried that it might flag some dips as bad
points, can check by seeing what happens with the known ones

light curves are not generated for stars affected by nearby bright stars
(or at least the ones flagged that way) -- so there will be no
lc#_cal/id.dat file even though the id is in the index#.csv file

- value added: can search for gravitational microlensing events as well

- ASAS-SN's magnitude range is 11<g<16
