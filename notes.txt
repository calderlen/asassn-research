for the dippers, 

EA - β Persei-type (Algol) eclipsing systems. Binaries with spherical or slightly ellipsoidal components. An extremely wide range of periods is observed, from 0.2 to ≥10000 days.

NL/VY - Anti-dwarf novae. VY Sculptoris stars. They are cataclysmic binary systems with a hot (35,000-65,000 K) and luminous white
dwarf that occasionally undergo fadings of more than 1 magnitude (up to several magnitudes) due to a low rate of mass
transfer. These fadings might last from days to years

GCAS - Eruptive irregular variables of the γ Cassiopeiae type. These are rapidly rotating O9-A0 III-Ve stars with mass outflow from
their equatorial zones. The formation of equatorial rings or disks is accompanied by a temporary brightening (pole-on stars like
ω CMa) or fading (equator-on stars like Pleione). Light amplitudes may reach 1.5 mag. in V.

UXOR - UX Orionis stars, which are collectively known in the literature as UXors. Subgroup of Young Stellar Objects that show
irregular variations with a wide range of amplitudes from barely detectable to more than 4 mag in V. Most of them are Herbig
Ae/Be stars but there are some T Tauri stars with later spectral types also showing the same behaviour. Large-amplitude
variability is confined to stars with spectral types later than B8. There are two principal components: (1) irregular variations on
time-scales of days around a mean brightness level that changes on a much longer time-scale (typically years), sometimes in
a quasi-cyclic fashion, and (2) occasional episodes of deep minima, occurring at irregular intervals but more frequently near
the low points of the brightness cycles.

EA/GS - 

GCAS+LERI - GCAS: Eruptive irregular variables of the γ Cassiopeiae type. These are rapidly rotating O9-A0 III-Ve stars with mass outflow from
their equatorial zones. The formation of equatorial rings or disks is accompanied by a temporary brightening (pole-on stars like
ω CMa) or fading (equator-on stars like Pleione). Light amplitudes may reach 1.5 mag. in V.; LERI: λ Eri type variables. Be stars with the light variation caused by rotational modulation or non-radial pulsations. Their light curves are usually double-waved and with changing amplitude. Periods in the order of 0.3 - 3 d.


RS - RS Canum Venaticorum-type binary systems. A significant property of these systems is the presence in their spectra of strong
Ca II H and K emission lines of variable intensity, indicating increased chromospheric activity of the solar type. These systems
are also characterized by the presence of radio and X-ray emission. Their light curves look like sine waves outside eclipses,
with amplitudes and positions changing slowly with time. The presence of this wave (often called a distortion wave) is
explained by differential rotation of the star, its surface being covered with groups of spots; the period of the rotation of a spot
group is usually close to the period of orbital motion but still differs from it, which is the reason for the slow change (migration)
of the phases of the distortion wave minimum and maximum in the mean light curve in the case of the eclipsing binaries
(E/RS). The variability of the wave's amplitude (which may be up to 0.5 mag. in V) is explained by the existence of a
long-period stellar activity cycle similar to the 11-year solar activity cycle, during which the number and total area of spots on
the star's surface vary.
